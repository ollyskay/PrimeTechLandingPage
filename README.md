# PrimeTech Digital Website

This project is a redesigned and redeveloped version of the PrimeTech Digital website, focused on enhancing user experience, design, and functionality. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website also incorporates Progressive Web App (PWA) features, making it responsive, installable, and accessible even offline.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized to deliver an excellent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **PWA Capabilities:** Includes offline access, installability, and fast loading times.
- **SEO Optimized:** Enhanced for improved visibility on search engines.
- **Modern UI/UX Design:** Clean and appealing layout, adhering to modern design principles.

## PWA Functionality

The website is designed to work as a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning users can install it to their devices and access certain features offline. Key PWA features include:

- **Offline Mode:** Users can access cached pages even when offline.
- **Installable:** The site can be added to home screens on mobile and desktops.
- **Manifest and Service Worker:** Configured to allow offline access, caching of assets, and providing an app-like experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the foundational structure of the site.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic elements.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Includes configuration files (`manifest.json`, `serviceWorker.js`) to enable offline access, installability, and faster load times.
